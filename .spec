# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application - I created the CLI class file that runs the program, asks for user input, and displays more detail when requested
- [x] Pull data from an external source - This program scrapes www.maximumfun.org to obtain a list of comedy podcasts, hosts, descriptions, and latest episodes, scraping both the index page of shows and the individual show pages
- [x] Implement both list and detail views - upon starting, the program displays a list of podcasts with hosts, and allows the user to select one podcast to view in more detail. After displaying details, the user has the option of searching another podcast or ending the program
